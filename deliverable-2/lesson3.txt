1. What are the call stack, callback queue, and event loop? How do they relate to each other?
Call stack
Simple data structure provided by v8 engine
Track execution of our program, keeps track of functions that are currently running

Callback queue
Maintain a list of all the callback functions that are ready to be executed
When a given event is done, the callback function gets sent to the callback queue which will execute the front item
Sent to the call stack to run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. When do functions move to the callback queue? When do they leave the callback queue?
Moves when a given event is done, it will leave the callback queue as the functions get executed from the first to the last
Sent to the call stack to run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is an HTTP request, and how do you make them?
A communication between a client (typically a web browser or app) and a server,
Using Fetch API in JavaScript
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is an API key and how is it related to HTTP requests?
API key is your unique key to call the API, you usually include your api key into the http request to be able to authenticate the call
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How do you add resilience to your HTTP requests?
Implement strategies to handle failures like try catch, ensure the application remains functional
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What are callback functions and why are they useful?
Function you define and pass in as an argument to another function with the intention of having it called later on
Useful because they can be dynamically called at a specific time
Non blocking, since itâ€™s not being called right away
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. How do you make a callback function?
Create the function and call it as an argument
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. What does encodeURIComponent() do and why is it useful?
Encodes URI makes sure the query parameters are valid, ensures data can be safely included in URL as a query parameter
